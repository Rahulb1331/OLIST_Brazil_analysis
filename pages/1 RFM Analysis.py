    - A vast majority of the customers are classified as Low Value customers, characterized by their less frequent purchases, older interactions and lower monetary contributions. They have to be targeted with thoughtfully designed re-engagement campaigns, considering that many might be one time customers.
    - In contrast, the High-value customers are more frequent, recent, and generate a higher revenue. Rewarding this segment with loyalty perks can help boost long-term engagement.
    - Because of this very skewed segmentation, relying solely on broad categories like "High-Value," "Medium-Value," and "Low-Value" may not be sufficient. Further segmentations - based on their recency, frequency and their monetary contributions - can enable the development of targeted strategies that cater to the unique behaviors and needs of each group.

        **Why I used a static, end-of-period segmentation**  
        - **Simplicity:** I computed RFM once on the full history keeping the to get three clear, stable groups (Low/Medium/High) for all downstream charts. Each custtomer is assigned to these segments using their last purchase date relative to the final reference date (i.e. Sept 2018). 
        - **Stability:** Since the dataset is  having many one-time purchasers, monthly re-segmentation produces huge spikes and drop‚Äêoffs (noise), not meaningful trends.  
        - **Cross-sectional clarity:** Business users see ‚ÄúRight now these 85.8 K customers are Low-value‚Äù and can tie actions (promotions, retention offers) directly to that snapshot.

        **Argument for adding a dynamic ‚Äúsegment flow‚Äù view**  
        - If we need to **track cohort movement**‚Äîe.g. ‚ÄúWhich Low-value customers in Q1 moved to Medium by Q3‚Äù‚Äîwe can recompute RFM quarterly or on a rolling 3-month window.  
        - **Cohort flow charts** (e.g. Sankey diagrams or stacked area charts) will then show true migrations without the jagged noise of one-time buyers.

        **Current setup**  
        **I have kept the core dashboard** on a **static segmentation** basis for all RFM, CLTV, churn, and MBA pages‚Äîthis provides a consistent grouping and straightforward business actions.  

        ### How RFM Segments Are Computed
        - **Reference Date:** Set to one day after the latest order in the filtered dataset.
        - **Recency (R):** Number of days since a customer‚Äôs most recent purchase.  
          - Score 4 if ‚â§Q1, 3 if between Q1‚ÄìQ2, 2 if between Q2‚ÄìQ3, else 1.
        - **Frequency (F):** Total number of orders per customer.  
          - Score 1‚Äì4 by quartiles: 1 if ‚â§Q1 up to 4 if >Q3.
        - **Monetary (M):** Total spend per customer.  
          - Likewise scored by quartiles.
        - **RFM Score:** Concatenate R, F, and M scores to form a three-digit code (e.g. ‚Äú4-3-2‚Äù).  
        - **CustomerGroup Assignment:**  
          - **High-value** if R ‚â• 3 & F ‚â• 3 & M ‚â• 3  
          - **Medium-value** if R ‚â• 2 & F ‚â• 2 & M ‚â• 2 
          - **Low-value** otherwise

        - **Medium-value** have moderate recency and frequency. They‚Äôve bought more than once but not enough to be high-value.  
        - **High-value** are the best customers: **recent**, **frequent**, **big spenders** (R‚â•3, F‚â•4, M‚â•4).

    **Combined RFM Heatmap Insights:**

    **Recency vs. Frequency:**  
    - A significant concentration of customers falls in the Frequency score of 1 across all recency levels, indicating a large base of one-time buyers.  
    - Conversely, a small but vital cluster with high frequency scores points to a loyal segment that, despite being smaller in number, is likely driving a higher share of repeat transactions.

    **Recency vs. Monetary:**  
    - The data shows that many customers reside in the lower monetary categories, often at intermediate recency levels. This suggests that while many buyers are active, they tend to spend less per transaction.  
    - However, discernible clusters in the higher monetary scores‚Äîeven across varying recency‚Äîindicate pockets of customers whose transactions are of higher value, highlighting an opportunity to boost revenue through targeted upselling.

    **Monetary vs. Frequency:**  
    - The majority of one-time buyers are positioned in the lower monetary segments. Yet, the high monetary segment also features a somewhat notable group with high frequency scores, revealing an elite group of customers who not only spend more but also purchase repeatedly.
    - This dual insight bridges both value and engagement, underscoring that high-value customers are not just rare‚Äîthey‚Äôre also consistently active.

    **Overall Takeaway:**  
    The three heatmaps together paint a comprehensive picture:
    - There's a dominant population of one-time, low-value buyers.
    - A small, yet crucial, group of high-frequency and high-value customers emerges across the analyses.
    
    **Actionable Strategy:** 
    - Olist can focus on devising re-engagement campaigns and loyalty programs to convert one-time buyers into repeat customers while nurturing the high-value segment to maximize overall revenue. 
    - Olist can identify the likely churners ( R = 1 and F = 4).

        - **Only orders** placed by *those same* customers each month are then counted.  

        **What this means**  
        - We‚Äôre seeing ‚Äúorders by *existing* segment members,‚Äù not ‚Äúall orders that ever would qualify as Low/Med/High.‚Äù  
        - New one-time buyers won‚Äôt appear unless we re-run RFM and re-tag them for a later window.  

        **What can be inferred from the chart**  
        - **High-Value Segment**: Post Dec 2017, this group initially ramped up steadily. However, the graph shows that after mid-2018 there‚Äôs a marked decline in activity, suggesting a shift or saturation that may need further investigation.
        - **Medium-Value Segment**: shows a significant surge‚Äîpeaking around late 2017‚Äîfollowed by a rapid collapse. This trend implies that during that period, many customers either upgraded into the high-value group or disengaged entirely.
        - **Low-Value Segment**: The chart highlights a predominance of one-time buyers in the low-value group. There is an early peak in activity, after which the numbers taper off gradually, emphasizing the transient interactions of these customers.
        
        **Recommended next steps**  
        1. Olist can try to **re-engage lapsed Low-value customers** with targeted win-back emails or introductory offers.  
        2. They may try to **upsell Medium-value customers** during their peak engagement window to push them into the High-value tier.

Here‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening, step by step:

1. A date range is picked

    - Using the sidebar, the app is told ‚Äúonly look at orders between January 1 and October 31, 2018‚Äù (for example).
    

2. Filtering the orders

    - From the master list of every order ever placed, those outside the chosen window are removed.
    

3. Scoring each customer once‚Äîover the entire window

    - Recency: How many days ago was their last order within that window?

    - Frequency: How many orders did they place total in that window?

    - Monetary: How much money did they spend total in that window?
    

4. These three numbers are turnned into simple 1‚Äì4 scores

    - The full list of recency values are split into four equal‚Äêsized buckets (quartiles), then scores are assigned as follows ‚Äúanyone in the top 25% freshest orders gets an R-score of 4, the next 25% an R-score of 3,‚Äù and so on.

    - This same quartile trick is applied separately for frequency and for monetary, so each customer ends up with an R, an F and an M score between 1 and 4.


5. Collapsing R + F + M into one label

    - **High-value** if R ‚â• 3 & F ‚â• 3 & M ‚â• 3  
          
    - **Medium-value** if R ‚â• 2 & F ‚â• 2 & M ‚â• 2
