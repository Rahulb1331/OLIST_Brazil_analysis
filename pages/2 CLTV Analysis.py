‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:**  
We can see that the revenue across all three segments in the past 12 month is coming to be greater than the the predicted 12 month revenue by segment. 

This is mainly because, for the previous 12 month we are collecting the **revenue of all the customers** even **one-time purchasers**.  

The **BG/NBD + Gamma-Gamma** model predicts future revenue **only from current customers** based on their past behavior. That is those customers who have made **more than 1 purchases** on the platform. 
It **does not account for new customer acquisitions**.

Thus, the predicted 12-month revenue appears lower than the past 12 months.

BG/NBD (Pareto/NBD) and Gamma-Gamma models we require at least two purchases to estimate recency/frequency parameters. Without a repeat purchase, we can‚Äôt infer their ‚Äúdecay rate‚Äù or expected future order rate.

    **Insights on the Graph:**

    - **Distinct Cohort Behavior:**  
      The graph clearly differentiates between customer cohorts. The High CLTV segment shows consistently higher normalized values compared to the Medium and Low segments. This suggests that even though the High-value segment may comprise fewer customers, they are driving a more significant portion of the overall value.

    - **Stability vs. Variability:**  
      While the Low and Medium cohorts exhibit stable trends over time‚Äîindicating a baseline level of customer value‚Äîthe High cohort, despite minor fluctuations, remains markedly elevated. This hints at a dynamic purchasing pattern among the top customers, implying that strategies to nurture these relationships could yield high returns.

    - **Normalized vs. Actual CLTV:**  
      Using normalized CLTV is used here to compare the trends across cohorts, as it puts all values on a comparable scale. This is helpful to understand relative performance over time.

        **Insights from the Retention Rate by CLTV Segment Graph:**

        All the three segments have a low retention rate, further validating the observation that most of the customers are only making one puurchase on the platform. However, if the three segments have to be compared with each other. We can make the following conlusions:
        
        - **Highest Retention in Medium CLTV:**  
          The graph shows that the Medium CLTV segment has the highest repeat purchase (retention) rate, slightly above 0.03. This indicates that customers in this group are the most likely to make repeat purchases, perhaps due to a balanced mix of engagement and spending behavior.
          
        - **Strong, Yet Lower, Retention in High CLTV:**  
        Although the High CLTV segment consists of customers with a high lifetime value, their repeat purchase rate is slightly lower‚Äîjust under 0.03. This may suggest that while these customers contribute significant value when they purchase, they might do so less frequently.
          
        - **Lowest Retention in Low CLTV:**  
          The Low CLTV segment displays the lowest retention rate, about 0.02. This points to the possibility that customers in this segment are either less engaged or require different strategies to boost repeat activity.

        These insights highlight that while high-spending customers are valuable, the medium CLTV group demonstrates the best retention, suggesting targeted strategies for nurturing this cohort could potentially yield substantial long-term benefits.
